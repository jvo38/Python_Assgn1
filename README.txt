BMI AND BMR Calculator
----------------------

What:
-----

This is an active running program to calculate your BMI(body mass index) and BMR(basal metabolic rate) by getting a few information. It will calculate where your current statistics are and determines what you will need to do if you wish to gain or lose weight.
              - Statistics is based on weekly necessity for gains/losses.

How:
1. Determine where all your files are.

2. Open up terminal and change directories according to the location of the files.
(ls (figure where your files are), cd (change directory to appropriate place))


3. Once ready, run the file through python3.3. 
(example:~/Desktop$ python3.3 mybmii.py)

4. If done correctly, the first question would ask for your name.
              - 2nd question ~ only type "male" or "female"
              - Last question ~ only type "m" for metric or "c" for US unit.
5. Enjoy!
